mHealth_outlier-detection
=========================
R and Python work done for ICTD 2013 conference. R scripts and output for exploratory statistical analyses of public health data in a number of developing regions.

Initial upload of scripts - might clean this up at some point, but unlikely anytime soon. Please contact me at epmccart@gmail.com if you have questions about this work or want to borrow/build on the scripts in some way. I'm happy to help if you're interested.
